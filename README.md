# Styleasy

Styleasy is a front end web application designed to help developers reach a starting point for styling applications. Users can choose color palettes and font guidelines and save them for later access. If the users opts to "preview" their selections, the design of the Styleasy application will change to match their choices. I built this website using the React front-end framework. Data is stored and accessed using asynchronous fetch calls in Javascript and JSON Server. The website was styled using CSS, which included CSS variables that are dynamically altered through Javascript when a user is previewing their selections.

Styleasy is currently in the early stages of development. Here are some of the features to be included in the beta version.


- Choose from presets to act as a starting point when designing a kit
- Generate starter CSS code from within the app
- Expanded color selection options
- Mobile browser compatibility
- Shareable links for any style kit
- Share your kits to the cloud, where they can be accessed and rated by other users
- Two-factor authentication for increased security
